I am a third-year PhD Candidate in Sustainable Development at Columbia University. 

My research interests are between political economy, empirical industrial organizations and environmental economics. 

Before joining Columbia, I earned a Master in Quantitative Economics from the Paris School of Economics and a Bachelor in Economics and Social Sciences from Paris Sciences et Lettres. 

I also worked for the French Development Agency (AFD) for the Central Asia regional office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan where I was working on energy and water projects.
