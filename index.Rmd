I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in Sustainable Development at Columbia University. 

I am currently visitng UC Berkeley, sponsored by [Francesco Trebbi](https://ftrebbi.com). 

My research stands at the intersection of political economy, empirical industrial organization and environmental economics. 

Before joining Columbia, I earned a [Masters degree in Quantitative Economics from the Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/masters-program/ppd-public-policy-and-development/) and a [Bachelor's degree in Economics and Social Sciences from Paris Sciences et Lettres](https://psl.eu/formation/cycle-pluridisciplinaire-detudes-superieures-cpes). 

I also worked for the French Development Agency (AFD) at their Central Asia regional office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan where I was working on energy and water projects.
