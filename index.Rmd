I am a sixth-year PhD Candidate in [Sustainable Development at Columbia University](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/phd-sustainable-development) and a Research Fellow at the Columbia Center for Political Economy. 

I am interested in topics in political economy, environmental economics, and empirical industrial organization. 

Before joining Columbia, I earned a [Masters degree in Quantitative Economics from the Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/masters-program/ppd-public-policy-and-development/) and a [Bachelor's degree in Economics from Paris Sciences et Lettres](https://psl.eu/formation/cycle-pluridisciplinaire-detudes-superieures-cpes). 

I visited UC Berkeley in the Spring 2023, sponsored by [Francesco Trebbi](https://ftrebbi.com). 

I also worked for the French Development Agency (AFD) at their Central Asia regional office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan where I was working on energy and water projects.
